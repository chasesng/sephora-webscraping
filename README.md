# Sephora Webscraper
 The notebook accepts the url of a category present on Sephora's website.
A webdriver is loaded to scrape html data present on the page, extracting product information.

To obtain the ingredient information only present on each product's dedicated page, product url extracted in the first webscrape is used to navigate the next webdriver.

Data extracted is converted to its necessary array state to ensure that all 'child' data matches correctly with its 'parent', product.

This notebook utilizes the pandas, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup libraries.
